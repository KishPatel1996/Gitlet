Gitlet design structure:

Gitlet commands to implement:
  init
  add
  commit
  rm
  log
  find
  status
  checkout
    checkout file name
    checkout commit id file name
    checkout branch name
  branch
  rm-branch
  reset
  merge
  rebase
  i-rebase


General Idea:
Gitlet will have different 64-character commits folders, which each store the files commited in each commit.

Head.ser will contain most of the other information.
Information on current branch, such as id, staged files,inherited and unchanged files.
Look into Sets and hashmaps for this
